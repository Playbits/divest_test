## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced During Development

### 1. Sequelize Association Configuration Issues

One of the major challenges encountered during development was with **Sequelize associations**. While Sequelize provides a powerful way to define model relationships, several issues arose:

- **Associations Not Detected**: Despite defining `hasMany`, `belongsTo`, and `hasOne` relationships in model files, Sequelize frequently threw errors like:

  - `SequelizeEagerLoadingError: Model is not associated`
  - `Error: No Sequelize instance passed`

- **Cross-Model Import Conflicts**: Improper import paths or circular dependencies between model files often caused association definitions to silently fail.

- **Inconsistent Model Initialization**: Sequelize associations depend heavily on correct model instantiation and registration. Any deviation in naming or timing broke the relationships.

---

### 2. Workarounds and Solutions

Due to persistent issues with associations, a pragmatic workaround was applied:

#### âœ… Manual Foreign Key Queries

Instead of using `include` or `Model.associations`, I chose to manually query and link related data:

- Fetch parent models like `Order`, `Cart`, or `Transaction`
- Then perform a second query (e.g. `OrderItem.findAll`) using the primary keys
- Finally, use `Array.filter()` or `Array.reduce()` to manually group and nest related data

This approach offered:

- **More control**
- **Fewer runtime errors**
- **Easier debugging**, especially in complex relationships
